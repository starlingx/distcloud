class SwUpgradeOrchThread(OrchThread):
    """SwUpgrade Orchestration Thread

    This thread is responsible for executing the upgrade orchestration strategy.
    Here is how it works:
    - The user creates an update strategy from CLI (or REST API) of 'upgrade'
    - This ends up being handled by the SwUpdateManager class, which
      runs under the main dcmanager thread. The strategy is created and stored
      in the database.
    - The user then applies the strategy from the CLI (or REST API). The
      SwUpdateManager code updates the state of the strategy in the database.
    - The SwUpgradeOrchThread wakes up periodically and checks the database for
      a strategy that is in an active state (applying, aborting, etc...). If
      so, it executes the strategy, updating the strategy and steps in the
      database as it goes, with state and progress information.
